    <h2>What this is</h2>
    <p>This website is a portfolio and a technical experiment itself.</p>
    <p>
      Recently I have been checking how companies approach developers and it's always a similar process, each one
      having it's own way of getting in touch, but after some interviews the same thing just repeats over and
      over again, quickly getting exhausting. Feels weird to talk about myself over and over again so many times.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a developer, my line of work can be boiled down to solving problems and automating repetitive tasks while
      reducing resources usage, being it money, space, memory, cpu and usually the more important of them all:
      {' '}<strong>time</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following this line of thought this project came out to be an interesting experiment. Aggregate what I
      mention to every recruiter I talk to, they write it down and register at a different system the HR, or
      recruiting company or the HR of the hiring company itself, for me to take another technical test, to a new
      technical test to validate skills to do something I daily do. So, trying to reduce wasted time for everybody,
      this idea was born.

      I could just present my information here, readily available for everyone on the internet. But we all know
      (at least I hope so) that doing this can be very dangerous as people can impersonate you using your data.
      So with that in mind I came into the conclusion that if companies wanted a developer like me, who cares
      about data security, good practices and delivering quality products, they should give their information to
      be eligible to ask for mine.

      Below you can find a registration for you and the company you represent. After validating it and
      proving you aren't a scraper bot, you will have access to my Resume/CV, social media links, history, career
      history, previous live coding sessions I've made, source code links of my portfolio projects and my story.
